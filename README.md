<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](https://github.com/arvindpamuri/country-quiz/blob/master/quiz-demo.png)

Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo?
- What was your experience?
- What have you learned/improved?
- Your wisdom? :)

- Did not use any state management library, not even context API or hooks. Hence the code is verbose.
- Helped to very well understand lifting state up through components and the importance of state management.
- Used fischer-yates algorithm for random question generation.
- Only css
